Today it is spring. A warm breeze gently caresses the face, and the green leaves on the trees are beginning to unfold. There are many people in the park: children are running and laughing, adults are walking their dogs or reading books on benches. The café smells of freshly brewed coffee and pastries, and people are ordering cappuccinos and croissants. A street musician is playing outside, and his melodies fill the air with joy and tranquility. In the distance, snow-covered mountains are visible, majestically towering over the city. Clear weather is expected in the evening, perfect for walking and enjoying the beauty of the sunset.
